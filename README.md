# **UFOs**

## Overview of Project:

The purpose of this project was for Dana to provide a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. Building an HTML page that allows us to pull up information from JavaScript data files on the page. In addition to the date, table filters were added such as, city, state, country, and shape; utlizing these filters allows to break apart different sighting that occured throught the country.

## Results:

By creating a new funtion to loop through the dataset, keeping only the results that match the search criteria. The webpage will update with the search criteria after the user presses "Enter". When a user enters the website, user will see a title with a picture at the top of the page, along with a text info. As the user scrolls down, they will begin to see all the data that was populated. And on the left hand side of the page the user will find a "Filter Search" area where they can choose from, user can choose any of the 5 different filters. 

Process of using the "Filter Search" criteria:
- Entering Date
- Entering a City
- Entering a State
- Entering a Country 
- Entering a Shape

## If a user searched by city such as "bonita", the results will look like this:

## Otherwise the list and search criteria options will look like this:

## Summary: 
The website overral is simple and clean and it allows the user to filter through different search criterias if needed. One big drawback to the site has is to have a filter search criteria for "Country" when the data is all in the US. Personally, I do not think that should have been included since all the data was in the USA. Two of my recommendations for further development is to have the ability to search within dates, that will allow users to not have to know a specific date, but more of an idea of when it happened. The other recommendation is to be able to have more data for users to research, such as having data from other countries.
